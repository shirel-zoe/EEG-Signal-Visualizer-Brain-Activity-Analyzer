# EEG Signal Visualizer

This MATLAB project loads and visualizes EEG signals, providing an interface to analyze brain activity patterns. The application is designed for educational and research purposes in biomedical engineering and neuroscience.

## Features
- Load EEG signal data from `.mat` or `.csv` files.
- Display EEG signals in the **time domain**.
- Apply **basic filtering** to remove noise.
- Highlight specific brain wave bands (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Delta).
- User-friendly GUI with interactive buttons for visualization.

## How to Run
1. Open `eeg_signal_visualizer.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. Use the GUI to:
   - **Load EEG data** from your local directory.
   - **Visualize signals** in real-time plots.
   - **Apply filtering** for noise reduction.
   - **Inspect brain activity** in different frequency ranges.

## Tech Used
- **MATLAB** (GUI development and signal processing)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for filtering and frequency analysis)

## Future Improvements
- Add **FFT-based power spectrum analysis** for frequency domain representation.
- Integrate **automatic brain wave band detection**.
- Implement **event-related potential (ERP) analysis**.
